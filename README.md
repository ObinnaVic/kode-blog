# kode-blog

This is a fully functional blog site built and developed within two to three weeks of coding and programming.
The site was a task given to me and my team comprising of collaborations with a UI/UX design team. 

This is a user-friendly site which enabled subscribed users to create blog posts, read blog posts, bookmark blog posts, make 
useful comments on various blog posts owned by other users of the kode blog site, reply on existing comments and replies, 
read in various languages including French, English and few more. 

Some tools and skills used in creating the site includes:
Pure HTML
CSS
JAVASCRIPT
BOOTSTRAP
FIGMA

Feel free to check out the site and if possible I would love some recommendations and critics.This would help me 
make the site a better site and much scalable for bloggers. It would also help me make good corrections and learn from them. THANK YOU.
